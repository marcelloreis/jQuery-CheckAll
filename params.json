{"name":"jQuery-CheckAll","tagline":"One-liner master/slave checkboxes","body":"# jQuery CheckAll Plugin #\r\n\r\n## It's really simple. ##\r\n\r\nBasic demo: http://jsfiddle.net/mattball/NBrg8/\r\n\r\n### Using the plugin ###\r\n\r\nTo use the checkbox with id `master` to control the checkboxes that are children of the form with id `myForm`, this is all you need:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#master').checkAll('#myForm input:checkbox');\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo override any of the default settings, pass in an `options` object as the second argument. For instance, if I don't want to update the master checkbox when a slave is changed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#master').checkAll('#myForm input:checkbox', {sync: false});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Options ###\r\n\r\nAll are optional (pun intended).\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey           | default | description\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsync          |  true   | boolean, keep the master sync'd with the slaves when a slave changes\r\nonClick       |  null   | callback function, called whenever a slave checkbox is clicked\r\nonMasterClick |  null   | callback function, called when the master checkbox is clicked\r\nreportTo      |  null   | callback function, receives the number of slaves currently checked\r\n```\r\n     \r\n### Bonus awesomeness ###\r\n\r\n- [It doesn't break if you accidentally select the master checkbox along with the slaves.](http://jsfiddle.net/mattball/fCEPa/)\r\n- It's lightweight thanks to `.live()`, so it can handle [as many checkboxes as you want to throw at it](http://jsfiddle.net/mattball/ZBjUV/).\r\n- Compatibility tested with jQuery 1.4.2 through 1.7.1.\r\n\r\n### Questions? ###\r\n\r\nPlease ask for help on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)! I prefer to answer in a public manner in case other devs have the same question.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
